# API-housing-project


Work in collaboration with AI team.

An IA student created an API allowing to predict the price of a house, according to certain criterias.

My work was here to create the application that will be the bridge between the API and the user.

Learning objectives :
  * Backend : connect to a homemade API using js and fetch
  * Frontend: Building a user friendly form
  * host the application
